# To-Do App

This is a simple, interactive To-Do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed by crossing them out, and delete tasks from the list.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Tasks can be clicked to toggle a crossed-out state, visually marking them as completed.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button that removes the task from the list.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be simple and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **Add a Task**: Enter a task description in the input field and press the "Add Task" button. The task will appear in the list below.
2. **Complete a Task**: Click on any task to toggle its state. The task will be crossed out to indicate that it is complete.
3. **Delete a Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list permanently.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page, including the form for adding tasks and the list of tasks.
- **CSS**: Styles the page, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. Includes basic layout, input styling, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic functionality of the app, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.

## Installation
